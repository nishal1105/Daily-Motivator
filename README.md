# Daily-Motivator
Exciting update on my latest Python mini-project, Daily Motivator! 🐍🚀

I have successfully created a system that sends one motivational quote daily on WhatsApp at a specified time. Here's a quick overview of the project:

🔧 Step 1: Installed Python and all necessary libraries, including Apscheduler, Twilio, and Requests, to set up all components.

📚 Step 2: Set up an API from Zenquotes to retrieve quotes in JSON format and format them to display a single quote with the author's name.

🔑 Step 3: Obtained the essential Access Key and Token on Twilio to enable seamless functionality.

🔄 Step 4: Implemented a Cron Job to automate the process, ensuring a motivational quote is scheduled and sent every day at a specific time.

🎯 Tracked the entire workflow on JIRA
